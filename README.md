# Measuring connectivity in spike train data
## Abstract

Understanding neural connectivity is pivotal for investigating the mechanisms underlying brain function and behavior. This review aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the procedures of neural connectivity analysis. It explores connectivity analysis within the domain of spike train data, emphasizing the distinction between functional and effective connectivity. It highlights data acquisition methods, including Neuropixels 2.0 and tetrodes, for capturing extracellular neural activity with high spatial and temporal resolution. It evaluates dynamic causal modeling (DCM), Granger causality (GC), and transfer entropy (TE) as principal methodologies for measuring neural interactions. Each method's theoretical underpinnings, practical applications, and associated challenges, such as handling nonlinear interactions, data stationarity, and computational demands, are critically examined. This review emphasizes the importance of interpreting results within the context of their methodological constraints and explores emerging advancements that aim to enhance the reliability and applicability of these approaches. By integrating technical insights with practical considerations, this work serves as a guide for selecting appropriate methodologies and advancing future research in neural connectivity analysis using spike train data.
